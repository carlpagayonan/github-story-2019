<h1>Spring 1981</h1>
<p>
    It was spring of 1952, I was sitting down on a bed of leaves under a tree in the college grounds. It was one of those days that you just want to relax and get away from studying and be alone by yourself. The shade of the tree was blocking half of my body, so I could feel the warmth of the sun from my waist down. I was enjoying listening to the breeze of winds and suddenly you walked by.

    I clearly remember saying to myself “How come I’ve never seen this girl here before?!”.
    It was my perfect moment of opportunity, she dropped one of her books as she walked by, allowing me to call after her. She then turned around feeling embarrassed.
