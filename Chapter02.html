<h1>The Introduction</h1>
<p>
    The next morning, I got up and had a smile on my face. The thought of meeting her again makes my heart beats fast.
    It’s a very exciting day for me the least. I left my dorm and walk at the entrance of the campus. Before I arrived, I have these thought that, “What if she was just playing with me and doesn’t show up?!”.
    I brush it all away and just kept walking. So, I arrive at the entrance of the campus. A few minutes later, there she was walking towards me, with a smile on her face.
