<h1>The Introduction</h1>

<p>
    The next morning, I got up and had a smile on my face.
    The thought of meeting her again made my heart beat fast.
    It was a very exciting day for me to say the least.
    I left my dorm and walk to the entrance of the campus.
    Before I arrived, I had the thought that, “What if she was just playing with me and doesn’t show up?!”.
    I brushed it all away and just kept walking. So, I arrived at the entrance of the campus and a few minutes later, there she was walking towards me with a smile on her face.

    As we walk towards the coffee shop, we introduce ourselves properly and we chat along the way. 
    It’s quite funny, I’ve never seen this girl around the campus before. I find her really amusing and I couldn’t stop starring at her. 
    We arrive in the local coffee shop, we sat down, and I bought her a drink. The coffee shop has two floors and it’s settled near the river banks which you can see from the distance. 
    She was amaze with the view and couldn’t believe that after all this time when she was living in the campus, she didn’t find this place. 
    We talked for hours and enjoy each other’s company. We head back to the campus and we both said our goodbye. 
    As I was walking away, she run back and gave me a kiss on the cheek and said, “I had a really good time, see you tomorrow?”
