<h1>The Introduction</h1>
<p>
    The next morning, I got up and had a smile on my face.
    The thought of meeting her again made my heart beat fast.
    It was a very exciting day for me to say the least.
    I left my dorm and walk to the entrance of the campus.
    Before I arrived, I had the thought that, “What if she was just playing with me and doesn’t show up?!”.
    I brushed it all away and just kept walking. So, I arrived at the entrance of the campus and a few minutes later, there she was walking towards me with a smile on her face.
