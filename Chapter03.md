<h1>End Of Spring</h1>

<p>
It was near the end of the semester and everyone was panicking finishing up their thesis and assignments.
My parents were asking where I will go after college, whether to stay in the same city to find a job or go abroad. 
I couldn’t decide since I’ve been seeing this girl. I want her to be included in my future. 
I didn’t know if she wanted to do the same. On that evening, I sat her down and made dinner. 
I brought the thought of what’s going through in my head. I didn’t want her to panic or make a rational decision about it. 
She told me she was thinking the exact same thing and wanted to do the same and that was the answer I was looking for!

It’s the end of the year and everyone was so delighted that they got the result they wanted.
Me and her graduated at the same time and we both got to meet each other’s parent’s. 
They were both happy enough with our decision staying in the city together, to look for jobs in the area. 
I’m grateful enough to have such lovely parents who acknowledge my decision. 
I am glad, I got to meet her at the start of the spring
