<h1>End Of Spring</h1>

<p>
It was near the end of the semester and everyone was panicking finishing up their thesis and assignments.
My parents were asking where I will go after college, whether to stay in the same city to find a job or go abroad. 
I couldn’t decide since I’ve been seeing this girl. I want her to be included in my future. I didn’t know if she wanted to do the same. 
On that evening, I sat her down and made dinner. I brought the thought of what’s going through in my head. I didn’t want her to panic or make a rational decision about it. 
She was thinking the exact same thing but not the answer I wanted.
She wanted to move away and work abroad. Her answer literally crushed me. 
I didn’t expect that from her but it’s her decision and I’d be happily to let her go.

<p>
It’s been a few days after our conversation and I haven’t heard from her. 
I went to her dorm once or twice, I know she was there, but she didn’t answer. 
A few days has gone by and It’s the end of the year and everyone was so delighted that they got the result they wanted.
Me and her graduated at the same time. I wanted to congratulate her, but she never even tried to look at me.  
I guess this was the end of our story.
