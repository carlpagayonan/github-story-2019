# Tittle: Endless Spring

## Chapter One
It was the start of spring 1952, I remembered I was sitting down underneath the tree in the college grounds. It was one of those days that you just want to relax and get away from studying and be alone by yourself. The shade of the tree is blocking half of my body, so I could feel the warmth heat from my waist down. I was enjoying listening to the breeze of winds and suddenly you walked by.It was the start of spring 1952, I remembered I was sitting down underneath the tree in the college grounds.
