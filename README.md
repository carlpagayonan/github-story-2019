# Tittle: Endless Spring

## Chapter One
It was spring of 1952, I was sitting down on a bed of leaves under a tree in the college grounds.
It was one of those days that you just want to relax and get away from studying and be alone by yourself.
The shade of the tree was blocking half of my body, so I could feel the warmth of the sun from my waist down.
I was enjoying listening to the breeze of winds and suddenly you walked by.
